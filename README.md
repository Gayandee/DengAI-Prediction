# DengAI-Prediction

## Problem Definition
Predict the number of dengue fever cases reported weekly in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Iquitos, Peru, using environmental data to aid in public health initiatives.

## Proposed Solution
We propose to utilize the dataset for a predictive task, as a regression task, to forecast the total cases of dengue fever. 
Mapping the Problem: The solution involves mapping environmental factors to disease incidence, aiding in resource allocation and research efforts to combat pandemics.
